🌟 Platform Compatibility & Background Design
Android Versions Supported
Target: API 23 (Marshmallow, Android 6.0) to API 34 (Android 14/15/16+)

Min SDK: Recommend API 23+ (Android 6.0+)

Below API 23, permissions and file access differ greatly; only partial support can be considered.

Most devices today are API 23+, so userbase impact is minimal.

Permissions & Media Access by Android Version
Android 6-9 (API 23-28):

READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE

File APIs: Direct path access via /storage/emulated/0

Android 10+ (API 29+):

Scoped Storage: MediaStore, limited direct access.

Need to migrate file operations via ContentResolver

Android 11+ (API 30+):

All Files Access: Must request MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE for complete scan. Show specific rationale (Privacy changes).

Android 13+ (API 33+):

Granular photo/video permissions (READ_MEDIA_IMAGES, READ_MEDIA_VIDEO)

Best Practice:

Use abstraction layer for file/media access:

Fallbacks to MediaStore for newer Android, direct access for old.

Progress, Responsiveness, and Persistence
Non-blocking UI:

All media scanning, compression, deletions on background threads via Kotlin Coroutines (Dispatchers.IO) or WorkManager.

Progress UI:

Use Lottie animations, progress bars, or percentage text.

Always show what’s happening (“Scanning 125/430 files”, “Compressing 2 of 12 photos…”).

Incremental Sync:

Persist gallery index, thumbnails, and metadata in local database (Room or SQLite).

On subsequent launches:

Load cached metadata instantly.

Only scan new or changed files using last-synced timestamp or MediaStore observer.

Progress bar: “Checking for new media…”

Smart Sync/Resume
On first launch:

Full scan → cache all info in DB.

Afterwards:

Fast load from DB.

Background scan for new/deleted/changed files (based on MediaStore or FileObserver).

If interrupted (app killed): store progress, resume from last operation.

User never has to wait for full scan again unless data/cache is wiped.

📱 Screen-By-Screen Deep Dive
Screen 1: Splash Screen
Objective: Display branding, start quick scan/resume.

Android Considerations:

Shortest possible time—skip if possible (show only if loading).

If loading takes >1s, show animated progress with “Preparing your space…”.

If app was previously initialized, show “Resuming session…” instead.

Persistence:

Store app’s initialization state, last sync time in SharedPreferences or local DB.

Screen 2: Permission Request
Objective: Get all necessary permissions per API level, explain privacy.

Android Considerations:

Show correct permissions for OS version (granular for Android 13+).

On denial: show limited mode or step-by-step help for enabling via Settings.

UX:

Always inform why permission is needed (no “dumb” dialogs).

Show animation (e.g., lock opening) while waiting for user.

If permissions are denied forever:

Show “Open Settings” button with animation.

Fallback: Limited mode with demo UI, prompt user later.

Screen 3: Home / Dashboard
Objective: Storage summary, quick access to core flows.

Android Considerations:

Display cached storage info immediately (from last session).

If device storage changes, start background refresh with spinner and “Refreshing stats…” message.

Support SD cards (show separate summary if available).

Persistence/Resume:

All home stats read from local DB, only background sync new info.

Progress bar: Show updating indicator only for new/changed files.

Screen 4: Gallery
Objective: Let user browse, filter, and select media with zero lag.

Android Considerations:

Show locally cached thumbnails immediately.

Start lazy loading for high-res images as user scrolls.

Use RecyclerView with DiffUtil for smooth updates.

For Android 10+ with scoped storage, use MediaStore queries for fastest access.

UX:

Always show some content (even partial) while background scan completes.

Pull-to-refresh triggers sync for new files.

When batch actions are triggered (delete/compress), show a detailed progress modal:

“Deleting photo 5 of 120…”

Option to cancel, resume, or background the operation (with notification).

Screen 5: Smart Suggestions
Objective: Display auto-flagged items instantly, even for large libraries.

Android Considerations:

On launch, show previously flagged (from local DB).

In background, start detection on new files only.

ML/AI (on-device):

Run on a background thread; show “AI is analyzing…” animation if needed.

Show partial results as soon as available.

UX:

Progress bar for “Smart Clean”: “Analyzing media: 50%…”

Tapping on a group shows instant results, starts further refinement in background if needed.

Screen 6: Compression Options
Objective: Allow seamless, user-defined compression with visible progress and zero app freezing.

Android Considerations:

Compression is always in background, never on main thread.

Use FFmpeg or built-in codecs with progress callbacks.

Handle device sleep:

Use WorkManager to ensure job completes, shows status in notification if app backgrounded.

UX:

Before/after preview is immediate (use thumbnail cache).

“Compress” shows animated progress: “Compressing 1 of 10… 32% complete”

User can cancel operation any time.

Screen 7: Best Photo Picker (AI Selection)
Objective: Offer instant suggestions; keep AI operations responsive.

Android Considerations:

AI model loaded only when needed, on background thread.

If group is large, show initial guess instantly, then refine.

UX:

Carousel updates with “AI is thinking…” shimmer if model’s still running.

“Keep Only This” is instant for already-processed results.

Screen 8: Settings
Objective: Allow user to control app, theme, learning, permissions with no lag.

Android Considerations:

Theme change applies immediately via LiveData/Flow.

“Re-check Permissions” handles different OS permission flows.

Screen 9: Review List
Objective: Show flagged media with batch actions.

Android Considerations:

Use cached results; update in background if files have changed.

Show reason for flag (blurry, duplicate, meme).

Deletions/compressions always in background with progress dialog.

Screen 10: Activity Log / Summary
Objective: Show past actions, undo if possible.

Android Considerations:

All log items are stored in Room DB.

Undo works for recently deleted items (moved to .trash folder) and is grayed out if file is gone.

UX:

Undo and clear actions show animated feedback.

Very large logs are auto-trimmed to last N entries (oldest removed).

Screen 11: Error/Empty/Permission Denied States
Objective: Keep user informed, never “stuck”.

Android Considerations:

Detect all error types (no storage, no media, permission denied).

Show big clear message with helpful action:

“Open Settings”, “Rescan”, “Grant Access”

Use friendly illustration or animation.

🛠️ How Data Is Synced & Kept Up-to-date
Initial Launch
Full media scan (with progress bar, skip to limited mode if denied).

Build local DB with all metadata.

On Subsequent Launches
Instantly load from DB; UI is ready immediately.

In background:

Check for new/modified/deleted files by comparing DB to MediaStore/file system.

Update only what’s changed (delta sync), never re-scan whole device unless forced.

Show mini progress: “Syncing 3 new files…”

While Running
Observe MediaStore (ContentObserver) or use FileObserver for directories.

Auto-update DB when changes are detected (additions, deletions).

If an operation is interrupted (app killed), resume from last state (persist job info with WorkManager or in DB).

On Large Libraries
Paginate all lists.

Never block UI, always show some content, load more as user scrolls.

During Heavy Operations (Compression/Deletion)
Show detailed progress bar/dialog:

“Compressing 12/100 (12%)”

User can background operation—status continues in notification.

🚦 Edge Cases, Handling, and Failover
Partial permissions: Only show what’s accessible, explain limitations, and offer to re-request permissions.

Media deleted/changed outside app: Detect via observer, update UI instantly.

Low Storage: Before compression or move, check available space, warn user if low.

App crash or kill:

All operations persist progress to DB.

On next launch, show “Resume last operation?” or auto-resume.

User cancels operation: Rollback if possible; ensure data integrity.

✨ User Experience Principles
Never block main thread—UI always responsive.

Progress visible at all times for any waiting/loading operation.

Instant data on every screen via caching and local storage.

Background sync for new/deleted files; no need for full rescan.

Seamless resume for interrupted operations.

Graceful handling of errors, permissions, and device-specific behaviors.

📊 Persistence/Resuming – Data Flow
Room DB (or SQLite)

Store media file metadata: path, URI, thumbnail, type, date, size, status.

Store last scan timestamp, last completed operation.

On Startup

Load all screens from DB—instant UI.

Start background delta scan for any changes.

On Any Change (new media, deletion, compression)

Update DB incrementally.

Update UI reactively (LiveData/Flow).

If app is interrupted/killed

Persist job progress (compression, deletion) in DB/WorkManager.

Resume or rollback operation on next launch.

🔗 Technical Recommendations & Libraries
Room DB for persistent storage and fast load.

Kotlin Coroutines for all async work.

WorkManager for all background/long-running jobs.

LiveData or Kotlin Flow for reactive UI.

MediaStore/ContentResolver abstraction for cross-version compatibility.

Glide or Coil for thumbnail/image loading.

Lottie for smooth, animated progress.

AndroidX for all compatibility.

Final Note
This design will make ShrinkSpace feel instant, smart, and never-blocking, and work perfectly across Android 6 to Android 16+, even for massive media libraries. No screen will ever feel “stuck,” every wait is shown as progress, and returning users will always see their media instantly.
